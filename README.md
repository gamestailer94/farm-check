# Seagate HDD Farm Check

A tool to detect potentially fraudulent hard drives by comparing SMART and FARM power-on hours, as highlighted in the [possible Seagate hard disk fraud investigation reported by heise](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Fraud-with-Seagate-hard-disks-Dozens-of-readers-report-suspected-cases-10259237.html).

**IMPORTANT**: This tool is specifically designed for Seagate hard drives only. While it can read basic SMART data from any drive, the tool is practically useless for non-Seagate drives as the core FARM verification functionality is exclusively available for Seagate drives. Non-Seagate drives will be skipped during verification.

## Background

Recent reports have revealed cases of used Seagate hard drives being sold as new. This tool helps identify such cases by comparing two different power-on hour counters that are specific to Seagate drives:
- SMART Power-On Hours: The standard SMART attribute tracking total power-on time
- FARM Power-On Hours: A separate counter in Seagate's proprietary FARM log

In legitimate new Seagate drives, these values should be nearly identical. A significant difference between these counters may indicate a used drive being sold as new.

## Installation & Usage

### Standalone Usage

#### Requirements
- Linux system
- smartmontools version 7.4 or higher
- Root/admin privileges (needed for SMART access)

#### Installation
Install smartmontools (version ≥ 7.4):
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
apt-get update && apt-get install smartmontools

# Fedora
dnf install smartmontools
```

#### Running the Check
```bash
chmod +x check.sh
# Check a single drive
sudo ./check.sh /dev/sdX

# Check multiple drives
sudo ./check.sh /dev/sda /dev/sdb

# Check all drives
sudo ./check.sh ALL
```
Replace `/dev/sdX` with your drive's device path (e.g., `/dev/sda`).

### Docker Usage

#### Requirements
- Docker
- Root/admin privileges

#### Using Pre-built Image
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/gamestailer94/farm-check:latest
# Check a single drive
docker run --privileged -v /dev:/dev ghcr.io/gamestailer94/farm-check:latest /dev/sdX

# Check multiple drives
docker run --privileged -v /dev:/dev ghcr.io/gamestailer94/farm-check:latest /dev/sda /dev/sdb

# Check all drives
docker run --privileged -v /dev:/dev ghcr.io/gamestailer94/farm-check:latest ALL
```
Replace `/dev/sdX` with your drive's device path (e.g., `/dev/sda`).

#### Building Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gamestailer94/farm-check.git
cd farm-check
docker build -t farm-check .
docker run --rm --privileged -v /dev:/dev farm-check /dev/sdX
```

## Output

The tool outputs:
- Device: Name of the device being checked
- SMART: Power-on hours from SMART attributes
- FARM: Power-on hours from Seagate FARM log (N/A for non-Seagate drives)
- RESULT: 
  - PASS: If the difference between SMART and FARM hours is ≤ 1
  - FAIL: If the difference is > 1, suggesting potential fraud
  - SKIP: If the drive is not a Seagate drive (no FARM data available)

## How it Works

1. Uses smartmontools to read both SMART and FARM power-on hour values
2. Detects if the drive is a Seagate drive by checking for FARM data
3. For Seagate drives:
   - Calculates the absolute difference between SMART and FARM values
   - Reports PASS if the difference is 1 hour or less
   - Reports FAIL if the difference is greater, indicating possible tampering
4. For non-Seagate drives:
   - Reports SKIP as FARM data is not available
   - Still displays SMART hours for reference

## Security Warning

⚠️ **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE** ⚠️

Both standalone and Docker methods require root/admin privileges to read SMART data from drives. The Docker container requires `--privileged` access, which gives the container full access to all devices on your host system. This is a significant security risk if misused.

**NEVER run untrusted containers with --privileged access!** This gives the container complete control over your host system, including:
- Full access to all devices and drives
- Ability to modify system settings
- Potential to compromise your entire system

Only run this tool:
- On systems you fully trust and control
- With containers you've built yourself or obtained from verified sources
- When you understand the security implications of privileged access
